Given slides of liver cells. There are 2 general cases: 
	Healthy (Normal) liver - 12 images -   6 sets of images at 1.25 and 2.0 magnification levels - image sizes range 1796-2605 (KBs)
	Non-healthy (APAP)     - 22 images -  11 sets of images at 1.25 and 2.0 magnification levels - image sizes range 1883-4048 (KBs)

	Each set has 1.25x and 2x magnification of the same region, with different staining methods applied
	None of the images are the same size

Goals(Need to confirm if these must follow an order:
	1. Image registration - 2D
	2. Reconstruct the 3D image

Planned Approach:
	Feature based detection. - Features being the lobules/holes/cuts OR Intensity??
	size agnostic 

Questions:
	Normal Liver
	1. What do the labels mean? CD3, CD20, CD68, etc

	2. Does CD3 in APAP file and CD3 in Normal file refer to the same area?

	3. Does staining effect intensity from image to image?
	3a.Was staining done in a specific order and do I need to layer the images in that order to 3D reconstruct properly?

	4. Does color channel matter?

	5. Are these images considered 3D volumetric data?

	6. Segmentation

Steps taken:

1. Data Collection
	Download/extract images
	Organized - 
		Create folders for each stain type within the Healthy/Non-Healthy groups. 
		Distributed images into folders manually.
2. Researched tools and methodology relevant to the goal at hand
	Dlib
		shape_predictor, train_shape_predictor,distance_to_line, 
		find_bright_lines, find_dark_lines, find_line_endpoints, sobel_edge_detector
		find_candidate_object_locations
3. Ideas to researchs
	image gradient
	instensity
	segmentation
